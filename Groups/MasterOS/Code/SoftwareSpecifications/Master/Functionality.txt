Modes of operation:
	TS Off
	TS On, but not Ready To Drive
	Ready To Drive

Transition procedures:
	TS Off -> TS On:
	Driver presses Tractive System Activation Button, which is connected to cRIO.
	This makes cRIO close its own shutdown system relay and begin blinking the
	LED in the Tractive System Activation Button.
	The cRIO will then send a Load Request to the AMS.
	The cRIO waits for a signal back from the AMS via the CAN bus.
	If the cRIO receives a CONTACTORS_ENABLED 1 signal within 45 seconds, it turns
	on the Tractive System Activation Button LED without blinking it to indicate
	activation success. The cRIO is now in TS On mode.
	Otherwise, the cRIO opens its own shutdown system relay and turns off the 
	LED in the Tractive System Activation Button to indicate activation failure.
	The cRIO is now back in TS Off Mode.

	TS On -> Ready To Drive:
	Driver presses Ready To Drive Button, which is connected to cRIO.
	This makes cRIO send a Ready To Drive CAN packet to the AudioVisual CAN
	interface and begin blinking the LED in the Ready To Drive Button.
	When the AudioVisual CAN interface receives this packet, it turns on the 
	Ready To Drive Sound for 1.5 seconds, then sends a Ready To Drive Allowed
	CAN packet to the cRIO.
	This makes the cRIO transition to the Ready To Drive Mode and turn on the
	LED in the Ready To Drive Button without blinking it.
	If the cRIO does not receive the Ready To Drive Allowed CAN packet within
	5 seconds, it turns off the LED in the Ready To Drive Button and returns
	to the TS On Mode.

	Ready To Drive -> TS On:
	Driver presses Ready To Drive Button, which is connected to cRIO.
	This makes cRIO send a STOP CAN packet to both Motor Controllers.
	cRIO then waits for both Motor Controllers to report a power target of 0
	via CAN.
	This makes cRIO transition to TS On mode and turn off the LED in the
	Ready To Drive Button.

	TS On -> TS Off:
	Driver presses Tractive System Activation Button, which is connected to cRIO.
	This makes cRIO stop sending a Load Request (optionally sleep mode) to the
	AMS, and turn begin blinking the LED in the Tractive System Activation Button.
	The cRIO waits for a signal back from the AMS via the CAN bus.
	If the cRIO receives a CONTACTORS_ENABLED 0 signal within 2 seconds, it 
	turns off its own shutdown system relay, and then turns off the
	Tractive System Activation Button LED to indicate deactivation success.
