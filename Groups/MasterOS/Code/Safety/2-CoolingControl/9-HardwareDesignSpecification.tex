\section{Hardware design specification}
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-5 section 7.1 -- 7.4.2
%
% Pre-requisites:
%    - Hardware safety requirements specification
%    - System design specification
%
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-5 section 7.3.1

\subsection{Pre-existing information}
% The following information can be considered:
%    - Software safety requirements specification
%
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-5 section 7.3.2

\subsection{SYSTEM NAME}
\subsubsection{Hardware architectural design}
% The hardware architecture shall implement the hardware safety requirements.
% Each hardware component shall inherit the highest ASIL from the hardware safety
% requirements it implements.
%
% The hardware architectural design shall be:
%    - Modular
%    - Granular
%    - Simple
%
% Non-functional causes for failure of hardware components shall be considered during
% the hardware architectural design, including temperature, vibrations, water, dust,
% EMI, cross-talk, etc.
%
% Required information:
%    - Specification of hardware components needed to implement the system
%    - Specification of internal interfaces and interactions in the system
%
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-5 section 7.4.1

\subsubsection{HARDWARE COMPONENT NAME}
% The hardware detailed design is at the level of electrical schematics representing
% the connections between hardware parts composing the hardware components.
%
% Non-functional causes for failure of hardware components shall be considered during
% the hardware architectural design, including temperature, vibrations, water, dust,
% EMI, cross-talk, etc.
%
% The operating conditions of the hardware parts used in the hardware design shall
% comply with the manufacturer specification of their limits.
%
% Required information:
%    - Detailed specification of the design of each hardware component
