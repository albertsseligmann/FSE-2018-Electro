\subsection{TECHNICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENT NAME}
% Hardware safety requirements shall be derived from each technical safety requirement
% allocated to hardware.
% If a technical safety requirement is allocated to both hardware and software, it should
% be partitioned to yield hardware only safety requirements.
%
% The hardware safety requirements shall include each hardware requirement that relates
% to safety, including:
%    - Safety mechanisms to control internal hardware failures, e.g. a watchdog timer
%    - Safety mechanisms to ensure the element is tolerant to external failures, e.g.
%      an open circuit input to a processor
%    - Safety mechanisms to comply with the safety requirements of other elements
%    - Safety mechanisms to detect and signal internal or external failures
%    - Hardware safety requirements not specifying safety mechanisms, e.g. avoidance
%      of unstable output, requirements for cables and connectors, etc.
%    - Fault tolerant time interval for safety mechanisms from technical safety requirements
%
% The criteria for verification of the hardware design shall be specified, including:
%    - Temperature, vibration, EMI, and other environmental conditions
%    - Supply voltage and other specific operational environment conditions
%    - Component specific requirements
%
% Required information:
%    - Hardware safety requirements for the technical safety requirement
