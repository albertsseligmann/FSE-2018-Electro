\section{Item definition}
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-3 section 5

\subsection{Pre-existing information}
% This section is for further supporting information such as a product idea,
% a project sketch, relevant patents, the results of pre-trials, the documentation
% from predecessor items, relevant information on other independent items.
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-3 section 5.3.2

\subsection{Functional requirements}
% A functional requirement is a requirement for what the item is supposed
% to accomplish.
% In general, functional requirements can be expressed in the form:
%     The item must do <requirement>
% Functional requirements are best specified by input/output listings,
% a mathemathical model/function or similar behaviour descriptions.
%
% Required information:
%   - Purpose of the item
%   - Functionality of the item, including operating modes and states of the item
%   - Assumptions on expected behaviour of the item
%
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-3 section 5.4.1

\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
% A non-functional requirement is a requirement for how the item should be.
% In general, non-functional requirements can be expressed in the form:
%     The item must be <requirement>
% Non-functional requirements are overall properties of the item such as quality
% requirements and constraints.
%
% Required information:
%    - Operational constraints such as prescribed behaviours for implementation
%    - FSE rule requirements
%
% Recommended information:
%    - Environmental constraints such as temperature and humidity
%    - Behaviour achieved by similar items, if any
%
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-3 section 5.4.1

\subsection{Boundary and interfaces}
% Required information:
%    - Elements of the item
%    - Assumptions about item's behaviour on other items
%    - Interactions with other items
%    - Functionality required by other items
%    - Functionality required from other items
%
% Recommended information:
%    - Distribution of functions among the involved systems
%    - Operating scenarios which impact the functionality of the item
