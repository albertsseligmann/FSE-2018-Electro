\section{Software unit design specification}
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-6 section 8.4.2 -- 8.4.4
%
% Pre-requisites:
%    - Software architectural design specification
%    - Software safety requirements specification
%    - Software verification report
%
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-6 section 8.3.1

\subsection{Pre-existing information}
% The following information can be considered:
%    - Technical safety concept
%    - System design specification
%
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-6 section 8.3.2

\subsection{SOFTWARE UNIT}
% The requirements of this clause shall be complied with if the software unit
% implements safety requirements or interacts heavily with units that do.
%
% The software unit design shall be described using the following notations,
% depending on the ASIL of the safety requirements it implements:
%    - Natural language
%    - Informal notations
%    - Semi-formal notations
%    - Formal notations
% In case of model-based development with automatic code generation, the
% methods for representing the software unit design are applied to the model.
%
% The specification of the software units shall describe the functional behaviour
% and the internal design to the level of detail necessary for their implementation.
%
% The software unit design and implementation at the source code level shall
% achieve the following properties:
%    - Correct order of execution of subprograms and functions
%    - Consistency of interfaces between the software units
%    - Correctness of data flow and control flow between and within software units
%    - Simplicity
%    - Readability and comprehensibility
%    - Robustness (e.g. prevention of implausible values, division by zero, etc.)
%    - Suitability for software modification/maintainability
%    - Testability
% Depending on the ASIL of the software unit, these properties shall be achieved
% using the following design principles:
%    - One entry and one exit point in subprograms and functions
%    - No dynamic objects or variables, or online test during their creation
%    - Initialization of variables
%    - No multiple use of variable names
%    - Avoid global variables or justify their usage
%    - Limit use of pointers
%    - No implicit type conversions
%    - No hidden data flow or control flow
%    - No unconditional jumps
%    - No recursion
% Some of these principles may not be applicable if using graphical or assembler
% programming.
