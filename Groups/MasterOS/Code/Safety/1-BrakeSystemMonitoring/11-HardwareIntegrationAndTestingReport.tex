\section{Hardware integration and testing report}
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-5 section 10.4.1 -- 10.4.6
%
% Pre-requisites:
%    - Hardware safety requirements specification
%    - Hardware design specification
%
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-5 section 10.3.1

\subsection{SYSTEM NAME}
% Hardware shall be tested using test cases derived from an appropriate combination
% of methods listed in DS/ISO 26262-5 Table 10.
%
% The hardware integration and testing activites shall verify the completeness and
% correctness of the implementation of the safety mechanisms with respect to the
% hardware safety requirements.
% To achieve this, the methods listed in DS/ISO 26262-5 Table 11 shall be considered.
%
% The hardware integration and testing shall verify the robustness of the hardware
% against external stresses.
% To achieve this, the methods listed in DS/ISO 26262-5 Table 12 shall be considered.
%
% Required information:
%    - Test cases and results of hardware integration testing
%    - Test cases and results of hardware robustness testing
%
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-5 section 10.4 and Tables 10 -- 12
