\subsection{TECHNICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENT NAME}
% For each software function whose failure could lead to a violation of the technical
% safety requirement, a software safety requirements shall be defined.
%
% The software safety requirements shall be derived from the technical safety
% requirements and the system design.
% The software safety requirements shall consider:
%    - System configuration parameters
%    - The hardware-software interface
%    - Relevant requirements of the hardware design specification
%    - Timing constraints of the system
%    - External interfaces (e.g. communication and user interfaces)
%    - All operating modes of the vehicle, system, hardware etc.
%
% Required information:
%    - Software safety requirements for the technical safety requirement
%
% Reference: DS/ISO 26262-6 section 6.4.1 -- 6.4.5
